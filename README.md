Preset realearn for Akai FL Fire:

You have to put this file in your ordner were you have your own preset. in the controller one... not main preset...
like: C:\Users\"yourname"\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Data\helgoboss\realearn\presets\controller\"user"\controller

then you can open it in your controller compartment in realearn

maybe the color of the pad are not really perfekt, because I m not so good with Lua code... If someone can give an issue, I would be happy. But it work.

I spend some time to make it. I like the akai fire because of the 16 column pads. good for Drum sequencer. 
Unfortunatly is this device, not easy to use with other Daw as FL studio, because of the feedback wich have Sysex communication.
I manage to use it as a sequencer controller with Bluearp vst and Sitala Drum sampler, but You can use it also for play time or every thing you want, thanks Helgoboss "realearn".

maybe I will upload my Main compartment Preset .json file, for who want to have it---
Let me know, if you are interessted

Have Fun with it!!
